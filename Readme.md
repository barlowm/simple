# Simple Web Browser Project

Some developers on a team I'm working with are advanced MUMPS developers, but as a general rule have little to do with Web Pages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So I started to put together a "simple" little project here that starts out going over a simple HTML5 boilerplate example. It then progresses to slightly more advanced topics such as NPM (Node Package Manager), build tools such as Gulp, using browser-sync to automate the reloading of the browser when changes are made, static checking using lint and prettier and includes some simple unit testing code with Mocha and Chai.

- Step 1 - Basic HTML5 Boilerplate
- Step 2 - Introduce .ENV file, Node Package Manager, Gulp, and browser-sync to Automate It
- Step 3 - Using Gulp to Build It with concatination and copying
- Step 4 - More advanced functionality - Using "Require"
- Step 5 - Some Stylistic Enhancements (lint, prettier)
- Step 6 - Back to Something "Simpler" - A JavaScript Only example
- Step 7 - Just The Tests - Simple Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai with and without Promises

This is an ongoing "late night" project on my part and there's not a lot of checking on my part for cleanup of docs and such, so please don't bash the developer too much :)  <--- No I don't go into BASH scripts here either --->
