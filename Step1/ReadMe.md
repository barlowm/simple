# Simple Web Browser Project

This is the initial branch of a simple Web Browser project that I'm using as a tutorial for various members of the project team I'm currently working with who have little to know general web application development knowledge (they're all experts in their own field which is InterSystems Cach√© / MUMPS and VistA (Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture)).

I'm starting this off by cloning the [HTML5 Boilerplate app](https://html5boilerplate.com/) from their [Github repository](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)   and then stripping off most of what's not needed and adding my own code.

Since many of the components here may not be familiar to everyone (heck some are new even to me!) check out the [Miscellaneous](doc.misc.md) file in the [Documentation](doc) section for more details.

Yes, there's a lot in here... And yes, you could simply create a plain index.html and put everything in there that you need for your web application (or an index.html and a javascript file or two). Or you could simply clone this app and start adding whatever you needed, build it... run static checks to ensure sane code, and unit tests.

The choice is yours...

Thanks
