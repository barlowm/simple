# Simple Web Browser Project - Just The Tests

Here we take a look at some simple Unit Tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/).

To run through the tests, as before first perform the (one time only) setup process to install the necessary programs and node_modules, then run the test via gulp

```
> npm run setup
> gulp test
```

That's it.

Take a look at the `get_data.js` file in the src folder and the `base.js` test file in the tests folder.
